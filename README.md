# Cut3r Roblox
A Roblox module script to operate cool CSG stuff.

Hello! 
## To install this
To install Cut3r, place Cut3r inside Tf replicated storage or server script service. (or if you have a dedicated module script folder, put the module there.)

To reference Cut3r in other scripts, type "require(game.ServerScriptService.Cut3r)" or "require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Cut3r)" or where ever else you decide to put the module. 
## Take note
Cut3r runs on the GNU general public license. This just means that you must make variations of Cut3r Open-source as well. You do not have to credit me, but please do :3
